# SelfMusicBot
A music bot designed to be hosted on normal Discord accounts
## ⚠ USING THIS SELF-BOT IS AGAINST DISCORD'S TOS AND MAY GET YOUR ACCOUNT BANNED

# Required packages
This bot needs the following packages: `PyNaCl, discord.py-self, yt-dlp`<br>
- Windows: `python -m pip install PyNaCl discord.py-self yt-dlp`
- Linux: `python3 -m pip install PyNaCl discord.py-self yt-dlp`

# Required in path
This bot needs FFmpeg and FFprobe to be in the path environment variable<br>
[Here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) you can find download instructions for FFmpeg and FFprobe<br>
To add them to the path environment variable on Windows, you can move both of them in `C:\Windows`

# But why?
This self-bot was made as a test for [Omniarchive](https://omniarchive.uk) due to it lacking a proper music bot<br>
This code base will be used for a proper normal bot for them
